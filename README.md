I am a lead engineer for the United States Department of Defense with 10+ years of experience performing engineering cost evaluations for multi-million dollar (and sometimes billion dollar) repair/spare proposals.  
I hold a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering with a focus on control systems and a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering.
